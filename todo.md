# Completed Tasks

## Add Sonner Toast Notifications ✅

Successfully implemented toast notifications using Sonner across all key pages:

### TeacherPage.tsx
- ✅ "Exam created successfully" - triggers when new exam is created
- ✅ "Exam deleted successfully" - triggers when exam is deleted via confirmation dialog
- ✅ "Exam updated successfully" - triggers when exam is edited and saved

### StudentPage.tsx
- ✅ "Registered for exam successfully" - triggers when student successfully registers for an exam
- ✅ "Unregistered from exam" - triggers when student unregisters from an exam
- ✅ Replaced `alert()` with error toast: "Unable to register for this exam..." - better UX with toasts

### ExamPage.tsx
- ✅ "Session activated - Room code generated" - triggers when teacher activates exam session
- ✅ "Session ended" - triggers when teacher deactivates/ends exam session
- ✅ "Student verified successfully" - triggers when teacher verifies a student's identity
- ✅ "Exam completed successfully" - triggers when student submits completed exam

### Implementation Details
- Used Sonner component from `src/components/ui/sonner.tsx`
- Imported `toast` from `sonner` package
- Added `<Toaster />` component to both teacher and student views in ExamPage
- All toasts use `toast.success()` for positive actions and `toast.error()` for errors
- Removed all `alert()` calls in favor of toast notifications for better UX

### Files Modified
1. `src/pages/TeacherPage.tsx` - Added 3 success toasts + Toaster component
2. `src/pages/StudentPage.tsx` - Added 3 toasts (2 success + 1 error) + Toaster component
3. `src/pages/ExamPage.tsx` - Added 4 success toasts + Toaster component in both views
