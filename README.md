Presentation Title: Cursor Hackathon: Streamlining Student Exam Logins

I. Introduction (5 minutes)
A. Current Challenges with Student Logins During Exams:
Description: Several issues hinder student logins during exams: mandatory computer login before the exam, exclusive reliance on ID cards (no Face ID, Smart ID, or mobile options), automatic logout upon leaving the classroom, and the need to re-login after breaks. This is compounded by 30 students and no IT support. 30 students per class. With total students taking the exam of 15 000. 
B. The "How the development looks like in Public sector?" Problem:
Description: Briefly touch upon the general challenges of public sector development, including the typical infrastructure (e.g., PostgreSQL, Redis, frontend), complex decision processes, and extended time scales, as a prelude to why an alternative development approach was necessary.
II. The "What If?" - Problem Reframing (5 minutes)
A. What We Know Today:
Description: Outline the existing data points: student registration for the exam, prior ID card login at home, confirmed student ID, the school where the exam takes place, the exam's scheduled time, and the type of exam.
B. Proposed Solution - The "Click Proto" Concept:
Description: Introduce the innovative idea of hashing public student data and exam information to generate a unique PIN. Explain how this PIN, for instance, a student's birthday and month, would serve to validate the student's identity. Detail the student's journey: registering, receiving PIN information, using the PIN to log in at the exam, the system validating the match between exam details and PIN, granting exam access, and ultimately deleting the hashes once the exam is completed.
III. The "How it went" - The Cursor Hackathon Approach (10 minutes)
A. Traditional Development vs. Hackathon Approach:
Description: Contrast the standard development process—which typically involves requesting a Proof of Concept (POC) from developers (architects, developers, analysts), dedicating at least one sprint, setting up a development branch and test environment, followed by legal review, teacher validation, and then a Jira ticket—with the streamlined hackathon methodology. Highlight the significant man-hours and costs incurred if a traditional solution proves unsuitable before even reaching the teachers.
B. The "Click Proto" Development:
Description: Explain the process of scaffolding a project in Cursor and detailing the Product Requirements Document (PRD). Emphasize that Cursor produced a pure vanilla HTML/JS/CSS clickable prototype. Crucially, explain why vanilla was chosen: to circumvent government computer limitations, as HTML files can be readily launched on such systems without requiring an IDE or additional software.
C. Validation and Documentation:
Description: Describe the structured process of presenting the solution to a select group of teachers to gather feedback and refine the prototype as needed. Detail the presentation to legal, which was informed by pre-gathered data insights, enabling them to pose more specific, rather than generic, questions. Conclude by mentioning the creation of a Jira ticket that already included a fully documented and prototyped user story with technical specifications, thus eliminating the need for further discovery.
IV. Present the Actual "Click Proto" (5 minutes)
A. Live Demonstration:
Description: Placeholder for the live demonstration of your interactive prototype. Explain its features and how it effectively addresses the identified challenges.
V. Result and Conclusion (5 minutes)
A. Outcome:
Description: Acknowledge the pragmatic outcome: "Nothing really - things are today as they were back then."
B. Key Takeaway:
Description: Emphasize the primary success: "But this approach helped us to save many man-hours and thus also the € of public money."
C. Future Implications/Discussion (Optional):
Description: Briefly discuss the broader implications of this agile approach for future public sector development projects or explore how this methodology could be applied in other contexts.
